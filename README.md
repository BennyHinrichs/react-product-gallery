# Potential TODOs

- Prefetch the large image on tile hover
- No scroll on body when modal is active (set overflow: hidden on main container)
- Split modal content into own component
- Make mini cart popover that displays the items in cart
  - Alt: make it so it filters to selected items when you click cart
  - Quantity badge probably doesn't work for triple digits haha
  - Should total item count and price be derived or done in single source of truth?
- Responsive CSS
